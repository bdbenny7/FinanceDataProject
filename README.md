# FinanceDataProject

In this data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. This project is meant to practice your visualization and pandas skills.

In this project We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.

We need to get data using pandas datareader. We will get stock information for the following banks:

Bank of America

CitiGroup

Goldman Sachs

JPMorgan Chase

Morgan Stanley

Wells Fargo

For this project we don't need any data file to read , we will read the data online with pandas-datareader library which helps us to directly access the data provided to through online resourses.
